# AGENTS.md

CoinStats CLI for the CoinStats Public API, designed for AI agents.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run generate:client
npm run build
npm test
node dist/index.js schema --pretty
```

## Layout

```text

```

## Rules

- Keep command coverage at 100% of the public OpenAPI snapshot.
- Add or update entries in `src/registry/commands.ts` when the public API changes.
- Re-run `npm run generate:client` whenever `openapi/coinstats-public-api.json` changes.
- Keep mutating operations behind `--yes`.
- Prefer JSON request bodies via `--body` or `--body-file` for POST/PATCH operations.

## Testing

- `npm test` must pass.
- `npm run build` must pass.
- `npm run check:coverage` must report that every public operation is mapped.
- Mock `fetch` in unit tests. Do not hit the live CoinStats API in automated tests.

## Gotchas

- The generator currently requires `./openapi/...` rather than `openapi/...` in the CLI script input.
- The published Mintlify OpenAPI snapshot currently exposes 51 paths and 52 operations.
- Vitest and ESLint currently target supported Node LTS versions. Avoid Node 23 in CI.
